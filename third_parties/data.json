The process starts with a single hypercube approximation of the set of SPE payoff profiles. Then the initial hypercube is gradually partitioned on to a set of smaller adjacent hypercubes, while those hypercubes that cannot contain any SPE point are gradually withdrawn. Whether a given hypercube can contain an equilibrium point is verified by an appropriate mixed integer program. A special attention is paid to the question of extracting players\u2019 strategies and their representability in form of finite automata.",

      "description": "Adaptive learning algorithms (ALAs) is an important class of agents that learn the utilities of their strategies jointly with the maintenance of the beliefs about their counterparts' future actions. In this paper, we propose an approach of learning in the presence of adaptive counterparts. Our Q-learning based algorithm, called Adaptive Dynamics Learner (ADL), assigns Q-values to the fixed-length interaction histories. This makes it capable of exploiting the strategy update dynamics of the adaptive learners. By so doing, ADL usually obtains higher utilities than those of equilibrium solutions. We tested our algorithm on a substantial representative set of the most known and demonstrative matrix games. We observed that ADL is highly effective in the presence of such ALAs as Adaptive Play Q-learning, Infinitesimal Gradient Ascent, Policy Hill-Climbing and Fictitious Play Q-learning. Further, in self-play ADL usually converges to a Pareto efficient average utility.",

      "description": "The problem of an effective coordination of multiple autonomous robots is one of the most important tasks of the modern robotics. In turn, it is well known that the learning to coordinate multiple autonomous agents in a multiagent system is one of the most complex challenges of the state-of-the-art intelligent system design. Principally, this is because of the exponential growth of the environment's dimensionality with the number of learning agents. This challenge is known as \"curse of dimensionality\", and relates to the fact that the dimensionality of the multiagent coordination problem is exponential in the number of learning agents, because each state of the system is a joint state of all agents and each action is a joint action composed of actions of each agent. In this paper, we address this problem for the restricted class of environments known as goal-directed stochastic games with action-penalty representation. We use a single-agent problem solution as a heuristic approximation of the agents' initial preferences and, by so doing, we restrict to a great extent the space of multiagent learning. We show theoretically the correctness of such an initialization, and the results of experiments in a well-known two-robot grid world problem show that there is a significant reduction of complexity of the learning process.",

      "description": "Classically, an approach to the multiagent policy learning supposed that the agents, via interactions and/or by using preliminary knowledge about the reward functions of all players, would find an interdependent solution called \"equilibrium\". Recently, however, certain researchers question the necessity and the validity of the concept of equilibrium as the most important multiagent solution concept. They argue that a \"good\" learning algorithm is one that is efficient with respect to a certain class of counterparts. Adaptive players is an important class of agents that learn their policies separately from the maintenance of the beliefs about their counterparts' future actions and make their decisions based on that policy and the current belief. In this paper, we propose an efficient learning algorithm in presence of the adaptive counterparts called Adaptive Dynamics Learner (ADL), which is able to learn an efficient policy over the opponents' adaptive dynamics rather than over the simple actions and beliefs and, by so doing, to exploit these dynamics to obtain a higher utility than any equilibrium strategy can provide. We tested our algorithm on a substantial representative set of the most known and demonstrative matrix games and observed that ADL agent is highly efficient against Adaptive Play Q-learning (APQ) agent and Infinitesimal Gradient Ascent (IGA) agent. In self-play, when possible, ADL is able to converge to a Pareto optimal strategy maximizing the welfare of all players.",
